## Team 

- __Project Manager__: [Eric Benson](https://github.com/ericbenson)

## Assignment

1. Create a replica screen of Vulcun lobby with at least 10 contests ( example : https://vulcun.com/user/lobby). 
	Features: 
  -  Contests list
  -  Contest filter at top
  - "Enter contest functionality" not required
  -  Win% not required
  -  Design doesn't matter

1. Create a page where we can enter contest id and click "INCREMENT" button. This will increment entry number of that contest on lobby page.

1. On contest increment, all connected users lobby should update immediately.

1. Contest which was increment should highlight for 3 seconds.
